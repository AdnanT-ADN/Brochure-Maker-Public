# Brochure-Maker-Public


A publicly distributed version of a brochure generator program. This version of the program is expected to stay in its primitive form and to only be used to showcase what has been achieved.

## Project Goals
The aim of this project is to practice and demonstrate the use of LLMs to generate custom Brochures in Markdown format that satisfies the users requirements.

## Out of Scope
The following features will not be included in this version:
- Performance improvements through asynchronization and threading.
- Full website implementation to support advanced operations.
- Custom designable templates.
- Alternative formatting variations e.g. PDF, Latex
